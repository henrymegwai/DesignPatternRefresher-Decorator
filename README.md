# Decorator Pattern

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It is achieved by creating a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete components.

Here is a WeatherForecst example, where WeatherForeCastLoggingDecoratore class is used as a wrapper to add more functionality(Logger) to a concrete implementation WeaterForecast service. Check the repo for more info. Enjoy!
